# What is this?

A Jolie linter for Atom (using Atom Linter).

# Installation

The first command is needed only if you have not installed [Atom Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) yet.

    apm install linter

    apm install linter-jolie

# To-do I am not planning to do myself right now (help is welcome)

Useful stuff that we could import from [the Sublime-Jolie plugin](https://github.com/thesave/sublime-Jolie):

- [] Automatic indentation
- [] Code Snippets

Also, we should put a screenshot here.
