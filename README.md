# What is this?

A Jolie linter for Atom (using Atom Linter).

# Installation

    apm install linter-jolie

Dependencies are installed automatically once you start Atom.

# To-do I am not planning to do myself right now (help is welcome)

Useful stuff that we could import from [the Sublime-Jolie plugin](https://github.com/thesave/sublime-Jolie):

- [ ] Automatic indentation
- [ ] Code Snippets

Also, we should put a screenshot here.
